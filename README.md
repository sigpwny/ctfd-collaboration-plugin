# CTFd collaboration

For the SIGPwny internal CTF, we have a lot of very smart students that are nervous to talk to their neighbors to collaborate or ask for help. This challenge type provides a reason to talk to their neighbor.

Each 'collaboration' challenge is tied to completion of another challenge. Once they solve another challenge specified in the configuration, a collaboration code is available on their profile to share with others.
